				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<Line />
					<p>I have recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science at Brunel University with first class honours. But before coming to the UK, I grew up in Malaysia where I completed my pre-university studies and majored in Business and Psychology.</p>
					<br/>
					<p>During my pre-university studies, I was learning how to code and develop simple java projects in my free time. When I graduated college in 2018, I discovered that my interests and passion lies within the technology industry.</p>
